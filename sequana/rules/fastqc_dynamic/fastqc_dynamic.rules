    This rule is a **dynamic** rule (see developers guide). It can be included
    in a pipeline with different names. For instance in the quality_control
    pipeline, it is used as fastqc_samples and fastqc_phix. Here below,
    the string %(name)s must be replaced by the appropriate dynamic name.

    Required input:
        - __fastqc_%(name)s__input_fastq:

    Required output:
        - __fastqc_%(name)s__output_done

    Required parameters
        - __fastqc_%(name)s__wkdir: the working directory

    Log:
        - logs/fastqc_%(name)s/fastqc.log

    Required configuration:
